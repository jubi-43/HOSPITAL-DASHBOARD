Title: HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ANALYTICS

Purpose

This project aims to assist hospital administrators in improving operational efficiency and patient care quality by analyzing historical hospital data. Currently, appointment scheduling and patient tracking are managed via spreadsheets, making it difficult to identify inefficiencies such as bottlenecks, appointment cancellations, and uneven doctor workload distribution.

Technologies Used

Power BI – for building interactive dashboards and data visualizations

SQL – for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation

Data Source: Provided by LearnBay for educational purposes


Power BI Dashboard Overview

The Power BI dashboard provides insights across four key areas:

1. Patient Insights

Total number of registered patients

Age distribution of patients

Repeat vs. one-time patients

2. Doctor Performance & Utilization

Number of appointments handled per doctor

Appointment distribution by doctor specialty

Cancellation and completion rates per doctor

3. Appointment Trends

Appointment status breakdown: Scheduled, Completed, Cancelled

Peak booking hours and traffic trends

4. Hospital Efficiency KPIs

Overall doctor utilization rate (Completed / Booked)

Average waiting time between appointments per doctor

Top patients by number of visits

Capacity vs. actual load (Assuming a max of 8 appointments per doctor/day)


**Outcome**

The dashboard enables hospital management to:

Identify underperforming departments or doctors

Optimize doctor scheduling

Improve patient flow and reduce wait times

Make data-driven decisions for better resource allocation
